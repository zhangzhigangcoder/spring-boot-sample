1.适用场景

		Abstract Factory design pattern is factory of factories

2.Advantages

	1) provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.
	2) removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code. 
	3) makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend. 
	   For example, we can easily change PC class implementation because client program is unaware of this.
	   
3.Examples in JDK
	1) javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance()
	2) javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance()
	3) javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory#newInstance()
