1.适用场景

	Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime
	
2. Important Points
	1) We could have used composition to create instance variable for strategies but we should avoid that as we want the specific strategy to be applied for a particular task. 
	   Same is followed in Collections.sort() and Arrays.sort() method that take comparator as argument.
	2) is very similar to State Pattern. One of the difference is that Context contains state as instance variable 
	   and there can be multiple tasks whose implementation can be dependent on the state 
	   whereas in strategy pattern strategy is passed as argument to the method and context object doesn’t have any variable to store it.
	3) is useful when we have multiple algorithms for specific task and we want our application to be flexible to chose any of the algorithm at runtime for specific task.
