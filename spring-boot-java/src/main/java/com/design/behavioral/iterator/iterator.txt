1.适用场景

	Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying represenation

2.Example in JDK

	1) Collection framework interator
	2) Scanner Class
	
3.Important Points

	1) Iterator pattern is useful when you want to provide a standard way to iterate over a collection and hide the implementation logic from client program.
	2) The logic for iteration is embedded in the collection itself and it helps client program to iterate over them easily.
