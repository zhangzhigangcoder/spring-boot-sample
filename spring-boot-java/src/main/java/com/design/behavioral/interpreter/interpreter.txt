1.适用场景

	Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.	

2.Example in JDK

	1) java.util.Pattern and subclasses of java.text.Format are some of the examples of interpreter pattern used in JDK.
	
3.Important Points

	1） can be used when we can create a syntax tree for the grammar we have.
    2） requires a lot of error checking and a lot of expressions and code to evaluate them. 
        It gets complicated when the grammar becomes more complicated and hence hard to maintain and provide efficiency.
