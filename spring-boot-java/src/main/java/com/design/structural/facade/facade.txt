1.适用场景

		Facade Pattern is used to help client applications to easily interact with the system 
	when the complexity increases or the interface behavior names are confusing, 
	client application will find it difficult to manage it.
	
2.Facade Design Pattern Important Points
	
	1) Facade design pattern is more like a helper for client applications, it doesn’t hide subsystem interfaces from the client. 
	   Whether to use Facade or not is completely dependent on client code.
	2) Facade design pattern can be applied at any point of development, usually when the number of interfaces grow and system gets complex.
	3) Subsystem interfaces are not aware of Facade and they shouldn’t have any reference of the Facade interface.
	4) Facade design pattern should be applied for similar kind of interfaces, its purpose is to provide a single interface 
	   rather than multiple interfaces that does the similar kind of jobs.
	5) We can use Factory pattern with Facade to provide better interface to client systems.
