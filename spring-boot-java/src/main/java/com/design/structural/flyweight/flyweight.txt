1.适用场景

		Flyweight design pattern is used when we need to create a lot of Objects of a class.
	Since every object consumes memory space that can be crucial for low memory devices, such as mobile devices or embedded systems, 
	flyweight design pattern can be applied to reduce the load on memory by sharing objects.
	
2.Before we apply flyweight design pattern, we need to consider following factors:

	1) The number of Objects to be created by application should be huge.
	2) The object creation is heavy on memory and it can be time consuming too.
	3) The object properties can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic properties, 
	   extrinsic properties of an Object should be defined by the client program.

3.Example in JDK
	
	All the wrapper classes valueOf() method uses cached objects showing use of Flyweight design pattern. 
	The best example is Java String class String Pool implementation.
